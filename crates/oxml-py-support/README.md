# oxml-py-support

Keep Python binding behavior consistent with shared content paths,
stale-handle detection, units, and errors.

## Capabilities

- Typed document content path segments.
- Revision capture and validation for stale element handles.
- Shared stale-element errors.
- EMU, inch, centimetre, millimetre, point, and twip conversions.
- Both native bindings share the same ordered path segments and revision
  checks, so structural mutation invalidates held Python handles consistently.

## Use it when

Use this crate only while implementing `rdocx-py` or `rpptx-py`. It is not published to crates.io and is not a Python package by itself.

## Relationship

The two PyO3 binding crates use it to keep Python-visible navigation and
revision semantics aligned. This crate contains shared Rust support, not the
PyO3 bindings or a user-facing Python package.

## Example

```rust,no_run
use oxml_py_support::{emu_from_inches, inches_from_emu};

let width = emu_from_inches(8.5);
assert_eq!(width, 7_772_400);
assert_eq!(inches_from_emu(width), 8.5);
```

Repository binding crates use `oxml-py-support = { path = "../oxml-py-support" }`. External publication is intentionally disabled.
